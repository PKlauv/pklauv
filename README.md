## Projects

### [Math Phenomena, Visualized](https://pklauv.github.io/Math-Phenomena/)

Interactive browser-based visualizations of chaos theory, topology, and fractals — Lorenz attractor, Mobius strip, Klein bottle, Sierpinski triangle, and Mandelbrot set explorer.

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=black)
![Plotly.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plotly.js-3F4F75?logo=plotly&logoColor=white)
![Canvas API](https://img.shields.io/badge/Canvas%20API-E34F26?logo=html5&logoColor=white)
![Supabase](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supabase-3ECF8E?logo=supabase&logoColor=white)

Single-page app, no build tools or frameworks. A few things worth noting: Web Workers keep the Mandelbrot renderer off the main thread so the UI stays at 60fps; Plotly.js (~3.5 MB) is lazy-loaded on demand so canvas-only tabs never download it; hash routing makes back/forward work like a normal site. Full Playwright test suite covering navigation, interactions, accessibility, and visual regression.

### [KeyCrack](https://keycrack-b419.onrender.com)

Educational password awareness tool that shows how predictable personal-info-based passwords really are. A custom probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) engine expands 30 weighted templates into ranked candidates -- each scored by real-world likelihood. Async FastAPI backend with a dual-database layer (Supabase PostgreSQL in production, SQLite locally), 74 pytest unit tests, Dockerized deployment, and GitHub Actions CI/CD. Nothing is stored.
